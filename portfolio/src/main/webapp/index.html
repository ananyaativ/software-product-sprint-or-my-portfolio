      <h2> About Me </h2>
      <p>Hi I am Ananya and my hometown is Delhi,India. I am majoring in Computer Science at University of Wisconsin,Madison.
           I am a fitness enthusiast and I love weight training but I am not a cardio person. I love eating as well as it makes me happy.</p>
      <p>In my free time, I bindge watch shows. I am huge fan of The Big Bang Theory, The Office, Community and the list is endless to be honest.
           I love watching movies as well and I am a huge marvel fan. My favourite super hero is Tony Stark as he didn't had any powers 
           and he used his knowledge to build cool stuff. He is also so funny and cool. I love the marvel show Loki and I would recommend everyone to watch it once in their lifetime.</p>
      <p>I love to dance as well. I can dance for hours anywhere anytime. I try to learn new dance forms in my free time but the most I like are the Indian dance forms.
           I play guitar as well but because I have so many hobbies I don't play it that often. I have this thing of learning new things in my free time. 
           I get obsessed with them for sometime and learn them and then I move on to learn something else.</p>
      <p> I love adventure as well and I am always down for somtheing adventerous and fun. I love travelling and my ideal trip is going on a backpacking trip. 
          I have done a lot of adventerous activities but I still have sky diving, bungee jumping and ofcourse world tour backpacking trip on my to do list. 
          If you have done anything cool I would love to hear about it and I bet I would be down to do it as well.</p>

	      <p> My hidden talent is that I can fall asleep easily. I can fall asleep anywhere and anytime in any position. I love sleeping and I always ensure that I get 8 hours of sleep everyday. 
              If I would ever have to pick sleeping or watching movie or going out I always prefer sleeping. Even when I have a lot to do or nothing to do I simply just go sleep. </p>
